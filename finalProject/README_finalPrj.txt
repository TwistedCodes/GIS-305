Project: West Nile Outbreak simulation:

A project that simulates areas of high risk for West Nile Virus in Boulder County, Colorado.
Project uses layers that include wetlands, known mosquito larval sites, Boulder Addresses, bodies of water
as well as OSMP properties. This project also allows user to gather data from a Google form for those who do not 
wish to have their area sprayed. The code will then create a buffer zone around said addresses. This will then allow 
for an output of areas of highest risk. 

The code will also create an output map as a PDF. There are some rendering options avalible in the code, which the 
user can alter if they know the RGB codes that they would like to use.

User needs access to ARCGIS Pro and a python friendly IDE.  

This project is intened to highlight areas of high risk for West Nile Virus while consdering
the requests of Boulder County residents who may not want their property sprayed.
